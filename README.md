## foo_spider_monkey_panel
This repository hosts my last update of the 32bit version

The 64bit version is still maintained [here](https://github.com/marc2k3/spider-monkey-panel-x64).

## foo_mpv
These builds are for compatibility with `foobar2000` `2.25` and later where relatve path handling was
changed breaking older versions of the component. They can still be buggy and these bugs
will not be fixed by me.

## foo_sort_playlists_by_name
Adds a `Sort playliosts by name` command to the main `File` menu.

## Other components
While no longer maintained, downloads are available here and documentation remains online:
